    <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Halloween has become one of the most favored holidays of the year. Between dressing up in costumes, going to parties and the beloved tradition
       of <em>trick-or-treat</em> there isn't much to love about it. Below are some DIY decoration ideas and how to make them.

    <p id="p1" >Another favorite part of Halloween is the decorations.  Almost everyone puts up some sort of interior decorations but lawn decorations are getting more and more popular over the years.
       Now, one way to go about this of course is to purchase outdoor lawn decorations but the cost can add up quickly and they don't always last very long in the unkind October weather. One way to get around this is to build/create
       your own lawn decorations.  For almost half the cost, if not more, you can make your own decorations out of inexpensive material that will last against the weather, and as you will see it is not hard at all.

    <h2>Lawn Decoration Ideas</h2>
    <p>When it comes to Halloween lawn decorations there are many different routes you can take.  One of the most popular is the <strong>cemetary</strong>. This can be as simple as a few home made tomb stones 
   with custom engravings or you can get even more elaborate by adding a <em>rickety fence</em>.  Other popular decorations are <strong>ghosts</strong>, <strong>witches</strong>, and <strong>spider webs</strong></p>

   <h3>Cemetery</h3>
      <p>DIY cemeteries are very easy and inexpensive to make at home.  I have found that the best
         material to use is 1.5 inch or 2 inch insulation styrofoam from either Lowes or HomeDepot.
         One 4' x 8' sheet can allow you to make at least four tombstones depending on what size you
         make them. 
         
         <img id="tombstonePic" src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FPN/DPQH/K2K9YKN5/FPNDPQHK2K9YKN5.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=565&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=aaf74fcaedf6c01613bf7cdef4de2b68"> 
          
      </p>

      <p>
         Start by lightly drawing the form of your tomb stones onto the styrofoam.  Then proceed by cutting
         out the shapes with a small hand saw.  Once your tombstones are cut out.  Use your creativity to cut out any "engravings" you would
         like on each one.  This step can be done by using a small exacto knife and chipping away at 
         styrofoam.  You can also print out a template to trace over with the exacto knife and then cut them 
         out.

         <div class="engravings">
         <img id="tombstonePic2" src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FI3/7SHY/K2K9YKNP/FI37SHYK2K9YKNP.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=882&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=160db6e874a6dcda31fcf124fe0b77ea">
         <img id="tombstonePic3" src="https://i0.wp.com/theladydiy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DIY-Tombstones_cutting-out-lettering-2.jpg?w=720&ssl=1">
         </div>
      </p>
      <p>
         Your next step will be to spray paint your tombstones with a gray or light gray color.  Once that dries add black paint to your
         engravings to make them stand out.

         <img class="tombstonePic4" src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F7Y/JAAQ/K2K9YKN7/F7YJAAQK2K9YKN7.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=400&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=b475dcffee3d0b5a16a559814f18b531">
      </p>
      <p>
         Once all of your paint has dried, the final step is to push two skewers into the very bottom of the tombstone. Two predrilled holes  
         help make this step easier. Just make sure you don't drill holes much larger then the thickness of your skewers.

   <h3>Ghosts</h3>
      <p>Depending on how in-depth you would like to get, ghosts can be done very easily or with a little bit more difficulty.  Eiether way 
         is significantly less money then purchasing them at a store. 
      </p>

      <h4>Easy Lighted Hanging Ghosts</h4>
      <ul>Items Needed</ul>
         <li>Dollar Tree paper lanterns (Amazon also sells them)</li>
         <li>Dollar Tree round plastic table covers (also on Amazon)</li>
         <li>Packing tape (Dollar Tree has the Jot brand)</li>
         <li> Scissors</li>
         <li>String or twine</li>
         <li>Black adhesive vinyl (Dollar Tree now carries adhesive vinyl, but you could also use a black garbage bag or color in the eyes and mouth with a Sharpie)</li>
         <li>Double-sided tape (if using a black garbage bag for eyes and mouth)</li>
         <li>Paper lantern lights (optional)</li>
         <li>Garden shepherdâ€™s hooks or a tree with branches you can reach (or you can hang them indoors)</li>
         </p>

         <p>First step will be to assemble the paper latterns. Then hang the latern lights (if you purchased them) inside the paper latern by tieing them to the center wire support. You will
            next open the white table covers and unfold it until you find the center.  Once you found the center, get a few pieces of packing tape 
            and drape them over. (You will have to either fold the table cover back in half if it's opened all the way, just make sure you have a crease in it before taping the center). Adding 
            the tape will help in reinforce it when the wind blows.
         </p>

         <img class="ghostPic" src="https://www.thenavagepatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Easy-Lighted-Hanging-Ghosts-A-Dollar-Store-DIY-009.jpg">

         </div>

         <p>Before fully opening the table cover, cut a tiny hole at the center, where you taped it. Then fully open the table cover.</p>
         <img class="ghostPic" src="https://www.thenavagepatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Easy-Lighted-Hanging-Ghosts-A-Dollar-Store-DIY-015.jpg">

         <p>Now pull the lattern hook up and through the hole you cut in the table cover. Letting the table cover loosely drape down and over the lattern.</p>
         <img class="ghostPic" src="https://www.thenavagepatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Easy-Lighted-Hanging-Ghosts-A-Dollar-Store-DIY-020.jpg">

         <p>The next step is to tie string to the lattern hook, you pulled threw the hole in the table cover. You can finish up here by tieing off the other end of the string 
            to a tree branch or hanging hook or add eyes you cut out of the black adhesive tape.

         <div>
            <p>Now, if you are feeling a little bit more creative and adventurous you can use chicken wire to create a see threw ghost.</p>
            <ul>Materials</ul>
            <li>36-inch-by-25-foot chicken wire, size 1/2 inch</li>
            <li>Heavy duty wire clippers</li> 
            <li>Leather garden gloves</li>  
            <li>Foam head form, female</li>  
            <li>Needle-nosed pliers</li>
            <li>Measuring tape</li>   
            <li>1-inch painter's tape</li>  
            <li>Baseball bat, child or adult-sized</li>  
         </div>

         <div>
            <p>I could get into great detail of how this is done but two great websites to use as references are <a href="https://www.ehow.com/how_12341033_make-chicken-wire-ghosts.html">https://www.ehow.com/how_12341033_make-chicken-wire-ghosts.html</a>

            <h4>I have tried both different types of ghosts and I will fully admit the chicken wire ghosts look the best.</h4>

               Now, there are many other decorations you can create on your own for not much money.  One of my favorite ones I made and to see the final product was a 
               bubbling witches cauldron over a burning fire.  It also is the one I get the most compliments and questions about.  If you are interested in making your own,
                watch the short video below. It is the one I followed.

               <p>I hope you learned a few different ideas for DIY Halloween decorations and try them out at home.  Always remember,
                  the best part about Halloween decorations: the more messed up they may seem, it just adds a bit more aging to them.
                  So don't be afraid if something doesn't look perfect in a haunted/spooky scenario nothing is supposed to be crisp and clean. This 
                  is why I love making my own.  Oh and saving money.
