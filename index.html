   <div class="opening">
    <p>Halloween has become one of the most favored holidays of the year. Between dressing up in costumes, going to parties and the beloved tradition
       of <em>trick-or-treat</em> there isn't much to love about it.
    </p>
    
    <p>Another favorite part of Halloween is the decorations.  Almost everyone puts up some sort of interior decorations but lawn decorations are getting more and more popular over the years.
       Now, one way to go about this of course is to purchase outdoor lawn decorations but the cost can add up quickly and they don't always last very long in the unkind October weather. One way to get around this is to build/create
       your own lawn decorations.  For almost half the cost, if not more, you can make your own decorations out of inexpensive material that will last against the weather, and as you will see it is not hard at all.

    <h2>Lawn Decoration Ideas</h2>
    <p>When it comes to Halloween lawn decorations there are many different routes you can take.  One of the most popular is the <strong>cemetary</strong>. This can be as simple as a few home made tomb stones 
   with custom engravings or you can get even more elaborate by adding a <em>rickety fence</em>.  Other popular decorations are <strong>ghosts</strong>, <strong>witches</strong>, <strong>spider webs</strong> and <strong></strong></p>

   <h3>Cemetery</h3>
      <p>DIY cemeteries are very easy and inexpensive to make at home.  I have found that the best
         material to use is 1.5 inch or 2 inch insulation styrofoam from either Lowes or HomeDepot.
         One 4' x 8' sheet can allow you to make at least four tombstones depending on what size you
         make them. 
         
         <img id="tombstonePic" src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FPN/DPQH/K2K9YKN5/FPNDPQHK2K9YKN5.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=565&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=aaf74fcaedf6c01613bf7cdef4de2b68"> 
          
      </p>

      <p>
         Start by lightly drawing the form of your tomb stones onto the styrofoam.  Then proceed by cutting
         out the shapes with a small hand saw.  Once your tombstones are cut out.  Use your creativity to cut out any "engravings" you would
         like on each one.  This step can be done by using a small exacto knife and chipping away at 
         styrofoam.  You can also print out a template to trace over with the exacto knife and then cut them 
         out.

         Your next step will be to spray paint your tombstones with a gray or light gray color.  Once that dries add black paint to your
         engravings with black paint.

      <p>
         Once all of your paint has dried, the final step is to push two skewers into the very bottom of the tombstone. Two predrilled hole 
         helps with this step.
