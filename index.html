    <p>Halloween has become one of the most favored holidays of the year. Between dressing up in costumes, going to parties and the beloved tradition
       of <em>trick-or-treat</em> there isn't much to love about it.

    <p>Another favorite part of Halloween is the decorations.  Almost everyone puts up some sort of interior decorations but lawn decorations are getting more and more popular over the years.
       Now, one way to go about this of course is to purchase outdoor lawn decorations but the cost can add up quickly and they don't always last very long in the unkind October weather. One way to get around this is to build/create
       your own lawn decorations.  For almost half the cost, if not more, you can make your own decorations out of inexpensive material that will last against the weather, and as you will see it is not hard at all.
